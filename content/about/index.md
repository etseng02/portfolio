## Hello.

## My name is Eddie Tseng.

## You visited my website.

## Prepare to read.

I am a Toronto based full stack web developer. I love solving interesting problems. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you are looking for web dev talent.

As a graduate from Ryerson University’s entrepreneurship and strategy program, I’ve always known that creating value, solving problems and self improvement were things that I’ve always loved doing. Becoming a web developer was a natural extension of those traits. Creating complex web applications, leading teams, and moving projects forward is what I do best. I’m constantly looking to improve my skills, my thought technology, and my life.

For me, pushing myself both mentally and physically is incredibly rewarding. I’ve pursued a variety of sports that have allowed me to push myself to the limits such as competitive badminton and competitive dragon boat. Currently, I'm trying to become the best that I can be at bouldering (rock climbing without ropes).

I'll never be satisfied with who I am. I hear a voice in my head telling me I that I can do more and be better. But for now this who I currently am.
