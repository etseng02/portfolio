## Hello.

## My name is Eddie Tseng.

I am a Toronto based full stack web developer. I love solving interesting problems. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you think I can fit your needs!

As a graduate from Ryerson University’s entrepreneurship and strategy program, I’ve always known that creating value, solving problems and self improvement were things that I’ve always loved doing. Becoming a web developer was a natural extension of those traits. Creating complex web applications, leading teams, and moving projects forward is what I do best. I’m constantly looking to improve my skills, my thought technology, and my life.

For me, pushing myself both mentally and physically is incredibly rewarding. It's fun to try my best, so when I decide to do something, I intend to achieve the highest level I can. I’ve pursued a few hobbies that have allowed me to push myself to the limits such as competitive badminton and competitive dragon boat. Currently, I'm trying to become the best that I can be at bouldering (rock climbing without ropes).

I'll never be satisfied with who I am. I hear a voice in my head telling me I can do more and I can be better. But for now, this who I currently am.
