<h2 id="hello">Hello.</h2>

<h2 id="my-name-is-eddie-tseng">My name is Eddie Tseng.</h2>

<p>I am a Toronto based full stack web developer. I love solving interesting problems. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you think I can fit your needs!</p>

<p>As a graduate from Ryerson University’s entrepreneurship and strategy program, I’ve always known that creating value, solving problems and self improvement were things that I’ve always loved doing. Becoming a web developer was a natural extension of those traits. Creating complex web applications, leading teams, and moving projects forward is what I do best. I’m constantly looking to improve my skills, my thought technology, and my life.</p>

<p>For me, pushing myself both mentally and physically is incredibly rewarding. It&rsquo;s fun to try my best, so when I decide to do something, I intend to achieve the highest level I can. I’ve pursued a few hobbies that have allowed me to push myself to the limits such as competitive badminton and competitive dragon boat. Currently, I&rsquo;m trying to become the best that I can be at bouldering (rock climbing without ropes).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll never be satisfied with who I am. I hear a voice in my head telling me I can do more and I can be better. But for now, this who I currently am.</p>
